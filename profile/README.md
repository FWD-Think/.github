## FWD: Think
FWD: Think is a new nonprofit organization that is formatted as a worker's cooperative, meaning all of our writers, organizers, editors, auditors, and sometimes our community, have a say in what we do day to day. If something is less than agreeable, the workers will vote directly on a way to move forward that all people agree with, not just a majority if that can be avoided.

Our newsletters are published weekly and are made by our writers and editors. Anyone who did not contribute to a specific article is encouraged to spend time reviewing their peer's work. The amount of time our collaborators spend is tracked with a clock-in clock-out system, so everyone can track their time spent being creative. The amount of hours on the spreadsheet at the end of the month for each person only partially determines their payment eligibility.

Donations are always accepted, and the money goes to all of our team members evenly. Bonuses are added on top for workers who go above and beyond in their work, these bonuses are handed out monthly. To promote fairness, auditor bonuses are handed out quarterly and depend largely on the public reception of their work, not that of the business. Auditor bonuses are nondiscretionary due to the nature of the auditor's work. They are also awarded discretionary bonuses like other workers but these bonuses, like the ones given to writers, are based on internal factors and are voted on.
